This analysis determines whether different approaches for increasing how fast teeth grow actually work. The results indicate that one kind of approach (increasing dosage level) has an effect. 

In this data, with several caveats, it is found that increasing a 0.5mm dose to a 1mm does have a greater effect on teeth growing than a dose change from 1mm to 2mm.

In real life, a comparable finding could be that we discovered that increasing the number of ads from 500 to 1000, in a period of time, perhaps to a particular customers, has a greater effect on customers purchasing a streaming service than increasing the number of ads from 1000 to 2000.
